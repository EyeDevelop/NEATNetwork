# README


## Welcome
I made this personal framework to create a Neural Network from scratch. This repo contains classes for
the main foundation, the network class, and some additions like a genetic algorithm. This project might
grow as time passes, because it's a very fun project to work on.

### Why not TensorFlow or Keras?
Because I found Keras and TensorFlow very difficult to work with without prior knowledge. I created
this framework to get a deeper understanding of Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithms. As an added
bonus, the frameworks you create yourself are the ones you will know how to use best and are the
easiest to improve on.

### How to install
This is a Python module, which can be installed with pip.

##### Requirements
* Python3.6+
* Pip

##### The actual install
```bash
